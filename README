Thoth-SC

a Sproutcore framework for connecting the Thoth server to a SproutCore application

Finishing a complete rewrite of Thoth-SC in order to keep most things out of the data source.

While everything before this rewrite had to be done through the data source, it is now possible
to use just ThothSC as main entry point for authentication and other function types.

The way the interaction with Thoth is done has changed by introducing a few different handlers:

specialMessageHandlers: 
   handlers to handle certain messages that have nothing to do with data, but system requests
   like authentication

dataMessageHandlers: 
   handlers to handle certain messages having to do with data replies. The data source registers 
   all the needed messages itself when initialised.
   
While different types of traffic clients were previously done by extending a different data source,
this has now been replaced with external clients, abstracting the traffic specification from the 
data source.

A cryptographic library has been added (which can also be easily extracted from ThothSC) to encrypt
passwords or other types of info.
